    Most existing programming languages provide little support to formally state
    and prove properties about programs. Adding such capabilities is far from
    trivial, as it requires significant re-engineering of the existing
    compilers and tools. This paper proposes a novel technique to write
    correct-by-construction programs in languages without built-in verification
    capabilities, while maintaining the ability to use existing tools. This is
    achieved in three steps. Firstly, we give a shallow embedding of the
    language (or a subset) into a dependently typed language. Secondly, we
    write a program in that embedding, and we use dependent types to guarantee
    correctness properties of interest within the embedding. Thirdly, we
    extract a program written in the original language, so it can be used with
    existing compilers and tools.

    Our main insight is that it is possible to express all three steps in a single
    language that supports both dependent types and reflection. Essentially, this
    allows us to express a program, its formal properties, and a compiler for it
    hand-in-hand, offering a lot of flexibility to programmers. We demonstrate this
    three-step approach by embedding a subset of the PostScript language in Agda,
    and illustrating it with several short examples. Thus we use the power of
    reflection to bring the benefits of dependent types to languages that had
    to go without them so far.

    Dependently-typed host languages empower users to verify a wide range of
    properties of embedded languages and programs written in them. Designers of
    such embedded languages are faced with a difficult choice between using a
    shallow or a deep embedding. The former is easier to use because the entire
    infrastructure of the host langauge is immediately available. Meanwhile,
    the latter gives full access to the structure of embedded programs, but is
    difficult to use in practice, especially when the embedded language is
    itself dependently typed. The main insight presented in this paper is that
    the choice between shallow and deep embedding can be eliminated by working
    in a host language with reflection capabilities: we start from a shallow
    embedding that can use all libraries and tools of the host language, and
    later use reflection to expose the deep structure of the embedded programs.
    Concretely, we apply this technique to embed three programming languages ---
    Kaleidoscope, SaC, and (a subset of) APL --- into the dependently typed
    theorem prover Agda, using dependent types to statically enforce several
    properties of interest. We then use Agda's reflection capabilities to
    extract the embedded programs back into the original language, so that the
    existing toolchain can be leveraged. In this process, statically verified
    properties of the host language are mapped onto runtime checks in the
    target language, allowing extracted programs to interact safely with
    existing code. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with
    the implementation and extraction of a convolutional neural network in our
    embedding of APL.

    We explore a data structure that generalises rectangular multi-dimensional
    arrays. The shape of an n-dimensional array is typically given by a tuple
    of n natural numbers. Each element in that tuple defines the length of the
    corresponding axis. If we treat this tuple as an array, the shape of that
    array is described by the single natural number n. A natural number itself
    can be also treated as an array with the shape described by the natural
    number 1 (or the element of any singleton set). This observation gives rise
    to the hierarchy of array types where the shape of an array of level l+1 is
    a level-l array of natural numbers. Such a hierarchy occurs naturally when
    treating arrays as containers, which makes it possible to define both rank-
    and level-polymorphic operations. The former can be found in most array
    languages, whereas the latter gives rise to partial selections on a large
    set of hyperplanes, which is often useful in practice. In this paper we
    present an Agda formalisation of arrays with levels. We show that the
    proposed formalism supports standard rank-polymorphic array operations,
    while type system gives static guarantees that indexing is within bounds.
    We generalise the notion of ranked operator so that it becomes applicable
    on arrays of arbitrary levels and we show why this may be useful in
    practice.

    This paper shows how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be
    implemented in APL. Its first-class array support ideally fits that
    domain, and the operations of APL facilitate rapid and concise creation
    of generically reusable building blocks. For our example, only ten
    blocks are needed, and they can be expressed as ten lines of native
    APL. All these blocks are purely functional, and they are built out of
    a small number of builtin operators, resulting in a highly portable
    specification that is immediately runnable and should be suitable for
    high-performance optimizations and parallel execution. This implies
    that APL can be seen as a framework to define shallowly-embedded
    machine learning DSLs without any external dependencies, making them
    useful at least for experiments and prototyping. We explain the
    construction of each CNN building block, and briefly discuss the
    performance of the resulting specification.

      We propose a new notation for data parallel operators on multi-dimensional
      arrays named tensor comprehensions. This notation combines the basic
      principle of array-comprehensions with syntactical shortcuts very close to
      those found in the so-called Tensor Notations used in Physics and
      Mathematics. As a result, complex operators with rich semantics can be
      defined concisely. The key to this conciseness lies in the ability to
      define shape-polymorphic operations combined with the ability to infer
      array shapes from the immediate context. The paper provides a definition of
      the proposed notation, a formal shape inference process, as well as a set
      of re-write rules that translates tensor comprehensions as a zero-cost
      syntactic sugar into standard SaC expressions.

     In this paper we present an optimisation for reference counting based
     garbage collection. The optimisation aims at reducing the total number
     of calls to the heap manager while preserving the key benefits of
     reference counting, i.e. the opportunities for in-place updates as
     well as memory deallocation without global garbage collection. The key
     idea is to carefully extend the lifetime of variables so that memory
     deallocations followed by memory allocations of the same size can be
     replaced by a direct memory reuse. Such memory reuse turns out
     particularly useful in the context of innermost loops of
     compute-intensive applications. It leads to a runtime behaviour that
     performs pointer swaps between buffers in the same way it would be
     implemented manually in languages that require explicit memory
     management, e.g. C.

     We have implemented the proposed optimisation in the context of the
     Single-Assignment C compiler tool chain. The paper provides an
     algorithmic description of our optimisation and an evaluation of its
     effectiveness over a collection of benchmarks including a subset of
     the Rodinia benchmarks and the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. We show that
     for several benchmarks with allocations within loops our optimisation
     reduces the amount of allocations by a few orders of magnitude. We
     also observe no negative impact on the overall memory footprint nor on
     the overall runtime. Instead, for some sequential executions we find
     mild improvement, and on GPU devices we observe speedups of up to a
     factor of 4x.

    Resilience for HPC applications typically is implemented as a CPU-based
    rollback-recovery technique. In this context, long running accelerator
    computations on GPUs pose a major challenge as these devices usually do not
    offer any means of interrupt. This paper proposes a solution to the
    aforementioned problem: it suggests a novel approach that rewrites GPU
    kernels so that a soft interrupt of their execution becomes possible. Our
    approach is based on the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) by
    Nvidia and works by taking advantage of CUDA’s execution model of
    partitioning threads into blocks. In essence, we re-write the kernel so
    that each block determines whether it should continue execution or return
    control to the CPU. By doing so we are able to perform a premature
    interrupt of kernels.

             This paper aims to foster cross-fertilisation between programming
             language and compiler research performed on different array
             programming language infrastructures. We study how to enable
             better comparability of concepts and techniques by looking
             into generic translations between array languages. Our
             approach is based on the idea of a basic core language Heh
             which only captures the absolute essentials of array
             languages: multi-dimensional arrays and shape-invariant
             operations on them. Subsequently, we investigate how to map
             these constructs into several existing languages: SaC, APL,
             Julia, Python, and C. This approach provides us with some first
             understanding on how the peculiarities of these languages
             affect their suitability for expressing the basic
             building-blocks of array languages. We show that the existing
             tool-chains by-and-large are very sensitive to the way code is
             specified. Furthermore, we expose several fundamental
             programming patterns where optimisations missing in one or the
             other tool chain inhibit fair comparisons and, with it,
             cross-fertilisation.

         that are based on a call-by-value semantics are known to be challenging.  A lot

         In this paper, we look at the problem of recursive array definitions within a

         definitions as long as there are no cyclic dependences between array elements.
         The paper provides a formal semantics definition, sketches possible
         compiler implementations and relates to a prototypical implementation of an
         interpreter in {OCaml}.
         Furthermore, we briefly discuss how this approach could be extended to other
         data structures and how it could serve as a basis to further extend mutually
         recursive value definitions in a call-by-value setting in general.},

        that has a runtime of about 12 hours for a signal execution cycle on a cluster
        utilising approximately 100 CPU cores. The program contains a sequential

        {The increasing complexity of modern hardware requires sophisticated programming
        techniques for programs to run efficiently.  At the same time, increased power of
        modern hardware enables more advanced analyses to be included in compilers.
        This thesis focuses on one particular optimisation technique that
        improves utilisation of vector units.  The foundation of this technique is
        the ability to chose memory mappings for data structures of a given program.

        Usually programming languages use a fixed layout for logical data structures
        in physical memory.  Such a static mapping often has a negative effect on
        usability of vector units.  In this thesis we consider a compiler for a
        programming language that allows every data structure in a program to have its
        own data layout.  We make sure that data layouts across the program are sound,
        and most importantly we solve a problem of automatic data layout reconstruction.
        To consistently do this, we formulate this as a type inference problem, where type
        encodes a data layout for a given structure as well as implied program
        transformations.  We prove that type-implied transformations preserve semantics
        of the original programs and we demonstrate significant performance improvements
        when targeting SIMD-capable architectures.},

            variants of it that employ OpenMP pragmas as well as explicit
            vectorisation.

            Our experiments demonstrate that the SaC implementation
            successfully combines a high-level of abstraction, very close to
            the mathematical specification, with very competitive runtimes.  In

        we consider the situation with SIMD accelerators, whose importance
        seriously increased in the last decade.
        Firstly appeared in the early 90es, being oriented exclusively on
        graphics acceleration, nowadays SIMD CPU extensions are used in a
        variety of fields.  The lack of standard and incompatibility of
        instruction sets through the different types of CPUs substantially
        increase the complexity of developing portable applications within
        the extensions.
        In this paper we present an abstraction layer implemented as a set of
        C language extensions within the GNU GCC compiler which provides an
        interface for SIMD vectors and operations independently from the
        architecture.  First of all, these abstractions allow to exploit SIMD
        extensions of a CPU explicitly, which is useful when auto-vectoriser
        fails.  Secondly, the abstractions are general enough to be mapped to
        any hardware supporting SIMD paradigms; hence the new abstractions

        Abstract =
        {Modern programming languages define a syntax that cannot be described precisely
        using context free grammars. This problem is well known, and as a solution
        there are parser generators like ANTLR, which generates LL(*) parsers rather
        than LALR/LR. Nevertheless, a lot of real-world parsers are implemented by
        hand. A great difficulty arises when there appears a need to introduce some
        changes to the grammar of the language. This implies that the parser
        has to be rewritten to include new rules and resolve the created
        ambiguities manually.

        Whenever radical changes to the language are required, it is understood that
        parser rewriting will be necessary. However, when syntax requires some
        extensions to the convenience of the user, it is natural to allow her to adapt
        the existing syntax of the selected programming language to her needs. In this
        paper we present a way of building a system that allows introducing dynamic
        changes to the grammar and that works on top of any recursive descent parser
        that meets some minor restrictions.

        The execution of the proposed system consists of 2 steps. First is matching a
        list of tokens against a regular expression built on tokens and encoded
        production names of the given grammar. And the second is transforming the
        result using a functional language. We demonstrate that using this approach
        makes it possible to i) give static guarantees regarding the transformation
        rules; ii) safely express non-trivial syntactical constructions; and iii)
        perform a restricted partial evaluation.},

        consider a simple application of this tool for discovering
        syntactic errors in mixed C and CPP code, where the produced
        combinations of C and collapsed preprocessor statements are analysed by
        a front-end, C-only static analysis tool.},

        {The Bachelor Paper under consideration deals with the problem of
        user interface creation and support. The paper studies the approach,
        which helps to create a user’s interface configuration and transform it
        into various kinds of user’s interfaces.

        The paper uses a specially developed library written in Python to
        create a user’s interface. The library has been made so that it can
        easily be adapted and enriched. The method can also be used for
        devices other than personal computer, as well  as for programs with a
        different architecture type.},
