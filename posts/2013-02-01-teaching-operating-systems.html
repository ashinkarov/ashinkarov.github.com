        <p>Teaching process should be fun and enjoyable for both parties: students and
teachers, otherwise it doesn’t make much of a sense. Studying operating systems
might become relatively complex endeavour as it normally includes a lot of
technical details, alternatives in designs and some low level programming. Also,
the amount of code that one might have to deal with could be really frightening.</p>
<p>In order to compensate the overall struggle, I’ve decided to concentrate on
the way things are named in UNIX-flavoured OS-es. The naming convention of
different types of processes is pretty much amusing if you think about it.
I don’t know who started it, but it has very noticeable demoniacal connotations:
<em>daemons</em>, <em>zombies</em>, <em>killing parents</em>, <em>orphans</em>, etc. Sounds quite scary,
isn’t it? Following that train of thought, I managed to come up with the
following assignment:</p>
<pre><code>Answer the following questions providing reasonable explanations:

1. What happens when a child kills its parent?
2. Can a zombie do so, or it is too dead for that?
3. Can a daemon become a zombie?
4. How long can an orphan live on it's own, if at all?</code></pre>
<p>I hope that it would add some giggle to the overall struggle.</p>
