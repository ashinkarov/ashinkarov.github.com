        <p>I gave a talk on <a href="https://types2023.webs.upv.es/">TYPESâ€™23</a> about
implementing rank-polymorphic arrays in dependently-typed theory.</p>
<p>The slides are <a href="../talks/2023-types">available here</a>, and the
extended abstract <a href="../pubs/2023-types-abstract.pdf">can be found here</a>
The abstract follows.</p>
<p>Rank polymorphism is the ability of a function to operate on arrays of
arbitrary ranks. The advantages of rank-polymorphism are twofold: very
generic array combinators and the ability to specify advanced parallel
algorithms such as scan or blocked matrix multiplication in a very
natural combinatorial style. In this work we present an embedding of
rank-polymorphic arrays within a dependently-typed language. Our
embedding offers the generality of the specifications found in array
languages. At the same time, we guarantee safe indexing and offer a way
to reason about concurrency patterns within the given algorithm. The
notion of array reshaping makes it possible to derive multiple parallel
versions of the algorithm from a single specification. The overall
structure of the proposed array framework is surprisingly similar to
categories with families that is often used to encode type theory.
Shapes are contexts, reshapes are substitutions, and arrays are
well-scoped terms.</p>
