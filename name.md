I was born in Latvia, which at the time was a part of the USSR.
My birth certificates are in Russian, and my name in Cyrillic is
*Артем Шинкаров*.  Its correct transliteration is *Artem Shinkarov*.

Unfortunately, in my passport, my name is transliterated into
*Artjoms Šinkarovs*.  Mind extra *s*-es at the end, *jo* in the 
middle and *Š* instead of *Sh*.  This is something I cannot change
due to crazy Latvian rules.

In the UK, my name was transliterated again, simply
by throwing away the diacritical symbols; so I ended up with
*Artjoms Sinkarovs*.

While Latvia recognises that this is a problem, no proper solution
has ever been implemented.  One poor solution that they offer is
to put the correct transliteration of your name in the passport.
Here is a snippet of my passport:

While this makes the story above more credible, it is an absolute
nightmare to enforce this extra name as the official
one in the documents.
