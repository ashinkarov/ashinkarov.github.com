I was born in Latvia, which at the time was a part of the USSR.
My birth certificates are in Russian, and my name in Cyrillic is
*Артем Шинкаров*.  Its correct transliteration is *Artem Shinkarov*.

Unfortunately, in my passport, my name is transliterated as
*Artjoms Šinkarovs*.  Mind extra *s*-es at the end, *jo* in the 
middle and *Š* instead of *Sh*.  This is something I cannot change
due to crazy Latvian rules.

In the UK, my name got transliterated again, simply
by throwing away the diacritical symbols; so I ended up with
*Artjoms Sinkarovs*.

While Latvia recognises that the transliteration mismatch is a 
problem, no proper solution has ever been implemented.  It is
possible to put the correct spelling of your name in 
the passport, which I surely did:

However, turning this spelling into the official one, in all
the documents, is a total nightmare.
