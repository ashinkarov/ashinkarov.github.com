I am an assistant professor at the
[Cyber Phisical Systems](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/groups/cyber-physical-systems)
group at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/).
My research is on compilers and programming languages.  I
am interested in bringing ideas from type theory and mathematics into
high-performance compilers.

I am _looking for PhD students_ who would be interested in working on type theory
and programming languages.

### Contact


* Email: <a href="mailto:tema@pm.me">tema@pm.me</a>
* My code is on the [Github](https://github.com/ashinkarov/) and [SaC Gitlab](https://gitlab.sac-home.org/public)
* I am on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ashinkarov)

In the official documents, e.g. my publications, the spelling of my name is *Artjoms Å inkarovs*.
While it is unusual to have multiple spellings of your name, [here is why I do](/name.html).


<!--I am a Research Associate in the 
[School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/)
at [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/).  Also, I am a visiting researcher
in the [Functional Programming Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/fp-lab/)
at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/) where I
spend most of my working hours these days. -->

My research focuses on high performance compilers for heterogeneous architectures.
Specifically, I am interested in SIMD style vectorisation of high-level 
languages.

## Some heading 2

During my research I was actively involved in [SaC](http://www.sac-home.org)
and [GNU GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org) development; I am still an active contributor
in both projects.  I have a strong interest in high performance compilers, 
runtime systems, type systems, etc.

Details of my work gets available in the publication section as soon as it gets
available.  If you have similar interests or have some suggestions regarding any
project I am involved, please do contact me.

### Teaching
During the last three years I was participating in the various courses at the
University of Hertfordshire and in the Heriot-Watt University.  Here is a page
that summarises the courses that I did.

### Other interests
Besides my main research focus I do enjoy well designed and well written 
software.  I do participate in a number of open-source projects fixing various
bugs and implementing missing features.  I also have a number of programs under
my github account which I find useful.

Non-technical interests include: cycling/hiking, jazz music, reading.
