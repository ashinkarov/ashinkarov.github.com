<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><p>The increasing complexity of modern hardware requires sophisticated
programming techniques for programs to run efficiently. At the same
time, increased power of modern hardware enables more advanced analyses
to be included in compilers. This thesis focuses on one particular
optimisation technique that improves utilisation of vector units. The
foundation of this technique is the ability to chose memory mappings for
data structures of a given program.</p>
<p>Usually programming languages use a fixed layout for logical data
structures in physical memory. Such a static mapping often has a
negative effect on usability of vector units. In this thesis we consider
a compiler for a programming language that allows every data structure
in a program to have its own data layout. We make sure that data layouts
across the program are sound, and most importantly we solve a problem of
automatic data layout reconstruction. To consistently do this, we
formulate this as a type inference problem, where type encodes a data
layout for a given structure as well as implied program transformations.
We prove that type-implied transformations preserve semantics of the
original programs and we demonstrate significant performance
improvements when targeting SIMD-capable architectures.</p></p>
