<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><p><span> We explore a data structure that generalises rectangular
multi-dimensional arrays. The shape of an n-dimensional array is
typically given by a tuple of n natural numbers. Each element in that
tuple defines the length of the corresponding axis. If we treat this
tuple as an array, the shape of that array is described by the single
natural number n. A natural number itself can be also treated as an
array with the shape described by the natural number 1 (or the element
of any singleton set). This observation gives rise to the hierarchy of
array types where the shape of an array of level l+1 is a level-l array
of natural numbers. Such a hierarchy occurs naturally when treating
arrays as containers, which makes it possible to define both rank- and
level-polymorphic operations. The former can be found in most array
languages, whereas the latter gives rise to partial selections on a
large set of hyperplanes, which is often useful in practice. In this
paper we present an Agda formalisation of arrays with levels. We show
that the proposed formalism supports standard rank-polymorphic array
operations, while type system gives static guarantees that indexing is
within bounds. We generalise the notion of ranked operator so that it
becomes applicable on arrays of arbitrary levels and we show why this
may be useful in practice. </span></p></p>
