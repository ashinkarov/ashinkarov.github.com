<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><p><span>In pursuit of requirements of modern software, high-performance
computing often offers a narrowly-tailored solutions that reduce
portability of software. As one of such examples in this paper, we
consider the situation with SIMD accelerators, whose importance
seriously increased in the last decade. Firstly appeared in the early
90es, being oriented exclusively on graphics acceleration, nowadays SIMD
CPU extensions are used in a variety of fields. The lack of standard and
incompatibility of instruction sets through the different types of CPUs
substantially increase the complexity of developing portable
applications within the extensions. In this paper we present an
abstraction layer implemented as a set of C language extensions within
the GNU GCC compiler which provides an interface for SIMD vectors and
operations independently from the architecture. First of all, these
abstractions allow to exploit SIMD extensions of a CPU explicitly, which
is useful when auto-vectoriser fails. Secondly, the abstractions are
general enough to be mapped to any hardware supporting SIMD paradigms;
hence the new abstractions could be considered as a step forward to a
new C language standard.</span></p></p>
