<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><p>This paper describes our experience in implementing the classical
<span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span>-body algorithm in SaC and
analysing the runtime performance achieved on three different machines:
a dual-processor 8-core Dell PowerEdge 2950 (a Beowulf cluster node, the
reference machine), a quad-core hyper-threaded Intel Core-i7 based
system equipped with an NVidia GTX-480 graphics accelerator and an
Oracle Sparc T4-4 server with a total of 256 hardware threads. We
contrast our findings with those resulting from the reference C code and
a few variants of it that employ OpenMP pragmas as well as explicit
vectorisation.</p>
<p>Our experiments demonstrate that the SaC implementation successfully
combines a high-level of abstraction, very close to the mathematical
specification, with very competitive runtimes. In fact, SaC matches or
outperforms the hand-vectorised and hand-parallelised C codes on all
three systems under investigation without the need for any source code
modification. Furthermore, only SaC is able to effectively harness the
advanced compute power of the graphics accelerator, again by mere
recompilation of the same source code. Our results illustrate the
benefits that SaC provides to application programmers in terms of coding
productivity, source code and performance portability among different
machine architectures, as well as long-term maintainability in evolving
hardware environments.</p></p>
