<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><p>Most existing programming languages provide little support to
formally state and prove properties about programs. Adding such
capabilities is far from trivial, as it requires significant
re-engineering of the existing compilers and tools. This paper proposes
a novel technique to write correct-by-construction programs in languages
without built-in verification capabilities, while maintaining the
ability to use existing tools. This is achieved in three steps. Firstly,
we give a shallow embedding of the language (or a subset) into a
dependently typed language. Secondly, we write a program in that
embedding, and we use dependent types to guarantee correctness
properties of interest within the embedding. Thirdly, we extract a
program written in the original language, so it can be used with
existing compilers and tools.</p>
<p>Our main insight is that it is possible to express all three steps in
a single language that supports both dependent types and reflection.
Essentially, this allows us to express a program, its formal properties,
and a compiler for it hand-in-hand, offering a lot of flexibility to
programmers. We demonstrate this three-step approach by embedding a
subset of the PostScript language in Agda, and illustrating it with
several short examples. Thus we use the power of reflection to bring the
benefits of dependent types to languages that had to go without them so
far.</p></p>
